# Bitwig Controller Extension for M-Audio Oxygen 49 MKII

Just adapted the known Javascript v1-API control script to the new Java API which is used since Bitwig Studio 2.

Successfully tested on Bitwig Studio 2.2.2 on Ubuntu Linux 17.10 with an Akai MPD 218 as second controller.

Haven't digged further into logic errors, bugs or enhancements because I just wanted to get my Oxygen running again with Bitwig.

Fork or let me know if you find one. Enjoy!

## Installation

Download the compiled extension from [here](https://github.com/FIXURL) and put it into your `~/Bitwig Studio/Extensions` folder.
Note that the `Extensions` path is probably different for Windows or Mac.

## Development

Just install an IDE of your favour (e.g. Netbeans) and create a project with existing sources.

You'll need Java JDK 1.8 and Maven installed to build even without an IDE.
